I have a dream  
Leaving behind the whole world  
With my mom  
living in another world where no sadness

 

But  
that just a dream........

 

I love my mom so much  
She is a good woman  
because her goodness  
She was hurt so sharply

 

I want to protect her  
sometime  
I hope I was a boy.....

 

I must be a strong girl  
facing the difficulty of future  
Now the dream is just a dream  
Maybe when I'm old  
I can let the dream come true  
So my dear mom.....  
please wait for me  
I'll give you a happy life.....

 

Now  
a new life is waiting for me   
Keeping my faith  
choosing my own life!   
No one can hold up my way!
